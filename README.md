## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges I encountered while building the app include ensuring the buttons in the navigation bar were well spaced. Another challenge, I encountered was making sure the header remains fixed at the top of the screen. Another challenge I encountered was when using the navigation bar, ensuring that the header does not cover the section title. A challenge I encoutnered was appropriately nesting and selecting features to customize the navigation bar buttons and positioning.
